# 3.  Use .NET 9 and C# language to backend application

Date: 2025-02-08

## Problem

I need to specify the platform and programming language for the business part of the application.

## Decision

I decided to use .NET 9 as the latest version of this platform - it is the framework I have the most experience with so far.

## Consequences

- The entire business part of the application will be written in the .NET 9 platform
- As the platform continues to be updated, we will be moving the entire project to the latest versions of the framework
