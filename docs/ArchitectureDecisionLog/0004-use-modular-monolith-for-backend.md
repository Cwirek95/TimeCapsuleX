# 4.  Use modular monolith architecture for the backend part of the application

Date: 2025-02-08

## Problem

I need to take an efficient approach to implementing our solution while maintaining modularity and scalability.

## Decision

I decided to build the business part of the application using modular monolithic architecture.

## Consequences

- Each module encapsulates its processes, promoting problem separation
- This approach increases the flexibility of our monolithic application, making it easier to maintain
